Platelet Cell Classification

Description
The Platelet Cell Classification project aims to accurately classify platelet cells using deep learning techniques. The project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classification,
incorporating both randomized and Bayesian optimization search techniques to enhance model performance. Additionally, transfer learning models such as VGG16 and VGG19 are applied to leverage pre-trained networks 
for improved accuracy. Furthermore, an ensemble model using callback techniques is implemented to combine multiple models for robust classification.
